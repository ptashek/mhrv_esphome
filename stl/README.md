This is an adapter that allows easy mounting of the DS18B20 probe sensors to a VentAxia Sentinel MHRV unit, without compromising any seals.

- remove the plastic port cover temporarily (top or side, depending on your unit)
- remove enough insulating foam from the top of the cover for the adapter to sit flush against it
- drill a 10mm hole in the cover so that the bottom of the adapter fits into it 
- glue the adapter in place, and seal around the drilled hole
- sensors slide in from the top with a tight enough fit to seal air gaps
